🎶 Track Master

Track Master is a full-stack, single-page music trivia game where users must name all the songs from a chosen artist's album or entire discography. The application uses the Spotify Web API for track data and a custom Node.js/Express backend with SQLite to manage a real-time leaderboard.

The application is deployed as two separate services (Static Site Frontend and Web Service Backend) on Render.
